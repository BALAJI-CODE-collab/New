            <h2>Stage 1: Empathize</h2>
            <p>Gain a deep understanding of user needs through interviews, surveys, and observations. This helps uncover insights into user behavior and preferences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Interviews:</strong> Conduct interviews with current iPhone users and potential customers to gather insights on their experiences, preferences, and frustrations.</li>
                <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> Distribute surveys to a larger audience to gather quantitative data on user preferences and common issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Observations:</strong> Observe how users interact with their current phones in different environments (home, work, travel) to identify usability issues and opportunities for improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus Groups:</strong> Organize focus groups to discuss what features users love and what improvements they desire in the next iPhone model.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Stage 2: Define</h2>
            <p>Analyze gathered data to identify core problems. Create user personas and problem statements to clearly define challenges and opportunities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Journey Maps:</strong> Map out the user journey to identify key pain points and moments of delight.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem Statements:</strong> Develop clear problem statements based on the insights gathered during the empathize stage. Example: "Users need an iPhone that offers significantly longer battery life and enhanced camera functionality because they want to stay connected and capture high-quality photos without frequent charging."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Stage 3: Ideate</h2>
            <p>Brainstorm and generate a wide range of creative solutions. Encourage thinking outside the box to develop innovative approaches to the problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brainstorming Sessions:</strong> Conduct brainstorming sessions with the product team to come up with innovative features and solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Mind Mapping:</strong> Use mind maps to visually organize ideas and explore various possibilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Sketching:</strong> Create rough sketches of potential design solutions and features. Example: Ideas generated might include a new battery technology that extends battery life, advanced camera features with AI enhancements, and a more durable design using stronger materials.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="prototype">
            <h2>Stage 4: Prototype</h2>
            <p>Create tangible representations of your ideas. Use low and high-fidelity prototypes to visualize and test solutions, making it easier to refine concepts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low-Fidelity Prototypes:</strong> Create simple mockups or models of the new features and design changes using materials like paper, foam, or basic digital tools.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Fidelity Prototypes:</strong> Develop more polished prototypes that closely resemble the final product, including working models with new hardware and software features. Example: Develop a high-fidelity prototype of the iPhone 15 with the new battery technology, improved camera system, and a redesigned, more durable casing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Stage 5: Test</h2>
            <p>Test prototypes with real users to gather feedback. This iterative process helps identify strengths and weaknesses, ensuring the final product meets user needs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Conduct usability testing sessions where users interact with the prototype to perform various tasks and provide feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Collection:</strong> Collect qualitative and quantitative feedback from users to understand their experiences and identify areas for improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Refine the prototype based on user feedback and retest as needed to ensure the final product effectively meets user needs.</li>
